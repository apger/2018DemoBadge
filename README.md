# 2018DemoBadge
KiCad Project to test desired features for 2018 PCB badges

Initial goals for Apger/Lu:
1.  exposing graphics by keeping substrate off of the underlying copper
2.  masking over copper graphics for a raised 3d image/effect
3.  importing high res graphics as stencils
4.  using a high-res graphic outline for cutlines to make an interesting shape for a badge
